# GraphQLDemo-IOS

Apollo iOS is a strongly-typed, caching GraphQL client for native iOS apps, written in Swift.

It allows you to execute queries and mutations against a GraphQL server, and returns results as query-specific Swift types. This means you don’t have to deal with parsing JSON, or passing around dictionaries and making clients cast values to the right type manually. You also don’t have to write model types yourself, because these are generated from the GraphQL definitions your UI uses.
